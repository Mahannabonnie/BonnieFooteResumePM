        "Bonnie was a student in my Product Management Bootcamp with Fullstack
        Academy. The boot camp is a rigorous and challenging 24 weeks (6 to 9
        hours/week of class plus homework and 5 written and presented case study
        assessments). It requires broad and deep learning about all aspects of
        modern product management - ranging from product strategy, product
        planning, persona development and user/customer research, requirements
        definition and prioritization, building roadmaps, managing the product
        development lifecycle, marketing, launch, and analytics. Bonnie was an
        eager learner, regularly sought input on her work and was an active
        participant in every class, and provided guidance and mentorship to
        students as well. I am confident Bonnie will make an excellent product
        manager and valuable addition to any product team." -Randy Pilkenton

              <strong><u>DANCE-</u></strong> I've grown up dancing my entire
              life, I started ballet at 5yrs old and loved the structure and
              control it offered on how to control and beautify your body. In
              high school I auditioned for and was accepted into the drill team.
              And then in college on the dance company. I felt so alive being
              able to perform in front of others and feel the music and crowd.
              Additionally, during that time I also learned, tap, jazz, and
              lyrical. during my Junior year I traveled to Las Vegas and
              competed individually with 600 other participants, winning 1st
              place in both Jazz and Lyrical. During my time in highschool and
              then college in the late 90's. I also learned breakdancing and
              participated in a breaking crew, named the "FBI- Fresh Breakers
              Inc." We would go compete with other crews, but most fun was
              heading out to the clubs and taking them on in the circle! Having
              a girl on a crew was always something you would pull out near the
              end, and my showstopping move was called the "Hellavus." Those
              years past once I got married, my dancing slowed down as I had my
              first two children. Then before my daughter, I began doing theater
              and loved getting back into the dance and performace scene! I've
              worked over the years in a volunteer copacity with Theaters and
              Ballroom dance companies. I have always loved moving, entertaining
              and being around others.

              Jolene. I realize as an adult it may seem odd to bring up who my
              "bff" is. However, Jolene has been apart of my life for a very
              long time now. We meet in December of 1994, during the middle of
              ninth grade. This December we will have been best friends for 30
              years. She has been with me during the most difficult and most
              wonderful of times. Though we may be states away, when we speak it
              is like she is in the next room. She represents loyalty and the
              qualities of enduring and accepting someone. She is a amazing
              strength and someone I'm lucky to call my closest friend.

              <strong><u>POISON HORN-</u> </strong>This is my Dad. It's one of
              my favorite pictures. I'm the oldest of seven siblings and here
              you see myself on the far right and then my brother and sister.
              All of us are sitting on my fathers back, ready for a round of fun
              and a game of what we called, "Poison Horn." When we were young my
              dad worked two full time jobs to help pay the bills and would only
              have a few hours to sleep a night. He'd get home after being gone
              about 16-17 hours and have 5-6 hours to sleep. However, he always
              would make time for us children to be him. Playing Poison Horn or
              the Floor is Lava are some of my favorite memories growing up. My
              father was exhausted, but he still made time for what mattered to
              him. For him that was us, even when he was tired. As a single mom
              of three children, raising them alone for the last 13 years I feel
              I can relate to how he must have felt at times walking in the door
              after work and children climbing all over him. Because of the hard
              work both my parents put into raising us, I feel I value family
              and can relate well to what people want in Their lives. No matter
              what stage of the family they are in.
